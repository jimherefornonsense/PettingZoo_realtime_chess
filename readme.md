### A PettingZoo environment of realtime chess game for RL training.
#### It's a modified version of the classic chess game framework on PettingZoo.

This project is an infrastruture setup for the idea of Dr. Tillquist at Chico State: 


Evolving Decentralized Real-Time Chess Strategies.


P.S. Still fixing a bug where sometimes the game won't end after checkmate, and it keeps going until all the pieces are captured.
