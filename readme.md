# Realtime Chess Game Environment for Reinforcement Learning Training

This project is a modified version of the classic chess game framework on PettingZoo, designed for use in training reinforcement learning models. Specifically, it is an infrastructure setup for an idea proposed by Dr. Tillquist at Chico State, which involves evolving decentralized real-time chess strategies.
